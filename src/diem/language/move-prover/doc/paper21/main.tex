\title{Fast and Reliable Formal Verification of Smart Contracts with the Move Prover}

\maketitle
\begin{abstract}
  The Move Prover (\MVP) is a formal verifier for smart contracts written in the
  Move programming language. \MVP has an expressive specification language, and
  is fast and reliable enough that it can be run routinely by developers and in
  integration testing.  Besides the simplicity of smart contracts and the Move
  language, three implementation approaches are responsible for the practicality
  of \MVP: (1) an alias-free memory model, (2) fine-grained invariant checking,
  and (3) monomorphization.  The entirety of the Move code for the Diem
  blockchain has been extensively specified and can be completely verified by
  \MVP in a few minutes. Changes in the Diem framework must be successfully
  verified before being integrated into the open source repository on GitHub.
