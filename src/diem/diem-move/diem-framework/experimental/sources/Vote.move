/// The Vote module is used to allow voting on proposals on the chain.

/// * Module M creates a ballot with a given `Proposal` and an approval policy using `create_ballot`
/// * It receives the BallotID corresponding to the ballot
/// * It submits votes using the `vote` function from the voters
/// * If a vote causes a ballot to be approved, `vote` returns `true` and Module M can proceed with the operation requested by the `Proposal`
